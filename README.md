# Weather-and-air-pollution
create Weather and Air Pollution App to get the recent weather and air pollution analytics for any city around the globe.
the app idea is based on getting the countries, cities, flags, and geocoding information from [countries and cities API](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/1134062/T1LJjU52#intro) and then using the geocoding info for each selected city through the app to get the [weather API](https://openweathermap.org/current) and [air pollution API](https://openweathermap.org/api/air-pollution). all credits of the  [design style idea](https://www.behance.net/gallery/31579789/Ballhead-App-(Free-PSDs)) belongs to  [Nelson Sakwa](https://www.behance.net/sakwadesignstudio). the web app consists of 2 pages:- the home page is a page consisting of a list of countries' capital cards when clicking any card it will redirect you to a details page that contains information about the selected city, latitude, and longitude city info, current city temperature and current air pollution level. you can as well use the search bar in the home page to search about any city by wrtiting country then , then city then press enter it will pop up the filtered results.
